I am a Web and Mobile Application developer who lives in Worthington, Ohio. My professional focus is on library information systems. I've worked with Java, Spring, PhoneGap, Objective-C, Android Java, IntelliJ IDE's, JIRA, node (and all that implies), etc.

The latest mobile app I contributed to was released to the App Stores in August, 2017. OCLC's Digby is a staff application for OCLC's [Worldshare Management Services](https://www.oclc.org/en/worldshare-management-services.html) and was written using the PhoneGap framework. In October, 2017 I attended PhoneGap Day in the New York City offices of Microsoft. At OCLC, I've also had a hand in the [API Explorer](https://platform.worldcat.org/api-explorer/apis) which is a tool for trying API's on the [OCLC Developer Network](https://www.oclc.org/developer/home.en.html).

I'm interested in building things with Raspberry Pi's.

* [www.traincounter.com](www.traincounter.com) has been running on an RPi 2 for 3 years now. Read more about it at the [git repo](https://github.com/geocolumbus/traindetector).

Here's my Hadoop cluster.

Sometimes I build enterprise Spring Boot apps for practice.

* [www.compressednews.com](www.compressednews.com) gathers developer news and compresses it down so I can stay current - efficiently. See the [git repo](https://github.com/geocolumbus/linkgrabber) for more info.

### More Information

I like to take photographs and ride my bike to stave off middle aged developer bloat. My kids are very busy and need rides everywhere. We built a workshop shed and lately they've been modding nerf guns. My wife Kelly works on the data side of IT. We have cats.

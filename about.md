I am a Web and Mobile Application developer who lives in Worthington, Ohio. My professional focus is on library information systems. I've worked with Java, Spring, PhoneGap, Objective-C, node, etc. I spend a lot of my private time figuring out how Amazon AWS works. I think running a private data center is an expensive luxury that is on the way out except for a few, select edge cases.

### More Information

I like to take photographs and ride my bike to stave off middle aged developer bloat. My kids are very busy and need rides everywhere. We built a workshop shed and lately they've been modding nerf guns. My wife Kelly works on the data side of IT. We have cats.

I'm interested in building things with Raspberry Pi's.

* www.traincounter.com has been running on an RPi 2 for 3 years now. Read more about it at the [git repo](https://github.com/geocolumbus/traindetector).

I build enterprise Spring Boot apps for practice. This odd bird is a news compresser. I use it all the time personally to keep up. www.compressednews.com. See the [git repo](https://github.com/geocolumbus/linkgrabber) too.
